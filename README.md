# Smartwatch-Data-Analysis
There is a lot of competition among the brands in the smartwatch industry. Smartwatches are preferred by people who like to take care of their fitness. Analyzing the data collected on your fitness is one of the use cases of Data Science in healthcare.
The dataset I am using for Smartwatch data analysis is publicly available on Kaggle.
This dataset was initially collected from 30 female users of the Fitbit smartwatch.

> Data Overview, Data Preprocessing, Data Calculations:

  * Smartwatch Data Analysis by importing the necessary Python libraries and the dataset.
    
  * And a look at whether this dataset has any null values or not.
    
  * And have a look at whether this dataset has any null values or not.
    
  * The column containing the date of the record is an object. We may need to use dates in our analysis, so let’s convert this column into a datetime column.
    
  * By reviewing all the columns; We will see information about very active, fairly active, lightly active, and sedentary minutes in the dataset. And combine all these columns as total minutes before moving forward.
    
  * And we have a look at the descriptive statistics of the dataset.

> Relationship Between Calories and Total Steps:

* The dataset has a “Calories” column; it contains the data about the number of calories burned in a day. 

* There is a linear relationship between the total number of steps and the number of calories burned in a day. 

> Conclusion:

* The data collected by a smartwatch about fitness using Python.

* The code demonstrates how to load and preprocess data, perform calculations, and create informative visualizations.
  
* The analysis indicates potential insights into the relationship between activity, calories burned, and daily patterns.

* Further exploration and analysis can be performed based on these initial findings to gain a deeper understanding of the data.

* Smartwatches are preferred by people who like to take care of their fitness.

* Analyzing the data collected on your fitness is one of the use cases of Data Science in healthcare.
